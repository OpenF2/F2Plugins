F2 is an open and free web integration framework designed to help you and other financial industry participants develop custom solutions that combine the best tools and content from multiple providers into one, privately-labeled, seamlessly integrated front-end. The [essential components](http://docs.openf2.org/index.html#framework) defined in the F2 documentation are the Container, Apps, Context and Registry&mdash;all supported under the hood by **[F2.js](http://docs.openf2.org/f2js-sdk.html)**, a JavaScript SDK which provides an extensible foundation powering all F2-enabled web applications. 

F2 is currently maintained by [Markit On Demand](http://www.markitondemand.com). Visit [OpenF2.org](http://www.openf2.org) for more information and follow [@OpenF2](http://twitter.com/OpenF2) on Twitter.
